1. This summer, my roommate got married! yay! It was an awesome and very happy day. However, she was super stressed during her engagement while planning her wedding, and I feel like that time should just be happy. So, to help make wedding planning less stressful, I want to create a wedding app where users can explore options for venues, photographers, florists, and more. They can like and save the ones they’re considering and favorite the ones they’ve chosen. The selected vendors appear on a page that also tracks and displays their budget. Additionally, there’s an AI feature where users can search for something like, “I want a wedding under $X that fits ____ vibe,” and the app will suggest options from the database
2. I'm thinking of using flutter/dart to learn IOS and android development. I'm also thinking of using supabase for my backend and database.
3. Week 1 - I'll have the UX mostly laid out. Week 2 - I'll do the backend and add the databases. Week 3 - I incorporate the AI search. Week 4 - I reach out to wedding vendors to add to the database and fix things.
